# TestTintAdjustmentMode

Test project to demonstrate that button with image is not tint-adjusted when
popover appears. The switch demonstrates turning the grey-tinting of the
button image on/off.

Note, this can also be done by adjusting the image set in Xcode as follows:

![Xcode adjust image set](xcode_screenshot-fs8.png?raw=true "Adjust image set")
